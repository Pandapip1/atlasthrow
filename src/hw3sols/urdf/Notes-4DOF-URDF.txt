We are showing several versions of the URDF:

They differ in whether they

  a) place the frames at the corners or at the center of the motors,
  b) include the intermediate frames,
  c) include visual elements for the links (long thin rods), the
     motors (thick cylinders), or the fingers.

All versions minimize the rotations.  That is, in the zero position,
all frames are aligned (only shifted/translated as appropriate).
